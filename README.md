# HomeAssistant Plugin for Enabling/Disabling Unifi Protect Alarms

This integration is heavily based on the work done on the official (unofficial) Unifi Protect Python library here:  https://github.com/uilibs/uiprotect.

I wanted a quick solution for enabling and disabling alarms from HomeAssistant, and I didn't have the time at the moment to integrate it properly into the official library so I put this together.

This integration simply exposes all Alarms as switches and you can enable/disable them.
